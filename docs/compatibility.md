# Compatibility status

RPHP implements a growing, tested subset of PHP. Its public dependency-platform
identity is PHP 8.2.0; some newer language behavior remains available as an
experimental RPHP extension, but it is outside that compatibility contract.
RPHP is not certified for a complete PHP version and must not be treated as a
drop-in PHP replacement. Passing a script is evidence only for the exercised
behavior.

## Official php-src PHPT baseline

The latest reproducible upstream baseline runs the unmodified `Zend/tests` and
`tests/lang` suites from PHP 8.4.21 commit
`7a64ae0507799547fbbd39b067bd3dd2c35e8fec` against all-features RPHP commit
`80137b6bbea3bbcb3241a269e0d6b6af3bd86890`, using runner commit
`12a17e489f666b42de3660d663da8183306f89ba`. The recorded run used arm64 and a
three-second per-process timeout. It discovered 5,259 PHPT cases.

| Suite | Pass | Fail | Skip | XFAIL | Unsupported | Timeout | Crash | Headline pass rate |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `Zend/tests` | 583 | 4,033 | 86 | 1 | 258 | 0 | 4 | 12.630% |
| `tests/lang` | 44 | 224 | 10 | 0 | 16 | 0 | 0 | 16.418% |
| **Combined** | **627** | **4,257** | **96** | **1** | **274** | **0** | **4** | **12.838%** |

The headline follows the published gate definition exactly:
`pass / (pass + fail)`. It does not count skips, the known upstream `XFAIL`,
unsupported cases, timeouts or crashes as passes. A stricter whole-corpus view
is 627 / 5,259, or **11.922%**; including crashes in the attempted denominator
gives **12.827%**. These numbers are intentionally pre-alpha and are not a
claim of PHP 8.4 compatibility.

The schema-4 execution profile makes the strict score less easy to mistake for
language coverage. Of 4,888 attempted cases, eight fail during `SKIPIF` before
the test body, 2,180 are rejected in the observed parse/compile stage, and
2,700 (**55.237%**) execute the test's `FILE` section past that stage. This is
not a second compatibility score: invalid-source PHPT cases are supposed to
stop in the front end, and reaching runtime says nothing about correct
semantics or diagnostic text. Exact negative-test passes are now counted in
the observed front-end bucket instead of being mistaken for runtime reach.

The largest failure groups are 2,035 parse failures, 1,248 runtime failures,
821 output mismatches, 145 compile failures and eight failed `SKIPIF`
evaluations; one known upstream expected failure is reported separately. Four
cases terminate by signal. Of the 96 skips, 65 require unavailable extensions
and 31 are selected by `SKIPIF`.
Unsupported cases remain in the total: 269 require per-process `INI` behavior
that the RPHP CLI does not expose, while five require PHPDBG or CGI/header
sections outside this CLI gate.

Relative to the retained `c470183` baseline, this run adds 24 passing cases
without losing a previous pass. PHP class aliases now share the exact
reference-counted class identity rather than copying a class definition, so
alias chains preserve methods, static state, inheritance, callbacks and
`instanceof` behavior across classes, interfaces, traits and enums.
`stdClass` is registered as a real internal class; `is_a()` and
`is_subclass_of()` honor string/autoload behavior and shared alias identity;
`function_exists()` accepts a leading namespace separator; and `var_dump()` is
variadic. Three previously crashing `try` cases now terminate normally, taking
the crash total from seven to four. The same 2,700 test bodies get past the
front end: this slice converts 24 already-runtime-reaching cases to exact
passes, reduces ordinary runtime failures by 51 and moves 30 cases to later
output comparison.

Relative to the retained `0fafdd4` baseline, the current run adds 36 passing
cases without losing a previous pass. The retained `c470183` checkpoint
isolates 12 of them. Request-local SPL callback stacks preserve
registration order, prepend, duplicate and unregister identity, guard recursive
lookups and propagate loader exceptions. `class_exists()`, `interface_exists()`,
`trait_exists()` and `enum_exists()` autoload the correct symbol kind while
honoring the opt-out argument and case-insensitive names. `method_exists()` now
autoloads string owners and sees abstract or non-public declarations instead of
using the stricter callback-callability test. Object-method callbacks can load
classes through ordinary unmodified `require`, matching Composer's primary
loader shape.

The reproducible Composer S0 gate now pins Composer 2.8.12 by version and PHAR
SHA-256, generates `vendor/` under reference PHP, and runs the resulting
unmodified `vendor/autoload.php` under RPHP. Its fixture verifies the returned
Composer loader object, the exact PHP 8.2.0 constants/function identity, direct
static PSR-4 class autoloading, and a Composer `files` function. A second
Composer-generated platform check requiring PHP 8.2.1 must fail under RPHP with
a `RuntimeException` that reports 8.2.0. This exercises include-expression
return values, direct static-call autoload, both forms of `strtr()`, and both
sides of Composer's generated PHP-version gate; it does not claim that Composer
itself runs under RPHP. Symfony support is admitted separately: the first
bounded S1 gates now execute the unmodified EventDispatcher 7.4.15,
HttpFoundation 7.4.16 and compiled Routing 7.4.15 components through
Composer's generated autoloader, plus a Symfony DependencyInjection 7.4.16
prebuilt container generated by reference PHP. The next bounded S2 diagnostic
loads a complete production FrameworkBundle 7.4.16 container and route cache
warmed by reference PHP and handles one synthetic `/health` request.
`extension_loaded()` remains conservatively false until individual extension
contracts are admitted.

The pinned Symfony EventDispatcher S1 fixture installs
`symfony/event-dispatcher` 7.4.15 and its locked dependencies with reference
PHP, then runs the unmodified vendor sources under both PHP and RPHP. Its
priority-ordered static callable scenario must produce `high>low|same`. This
admits the component's exercised dispatch path, including lazy `??=` writes,
by-reference listener sorting, nested append/writeback and dynamic callable
arrays; it is not a blanket compatibility claim for every EventDispatcher API
branch or the rest of Symfony.

The pinned Symfony HttpFoundation S1 fixture creates an unmodified synthetic
CLI `Request` and `Response` with query, form and header inputs, then compares
reference PHP and RPHP byte-for-byte. Its required output is
`201|http-foundation|POST|/hello|RPHP|value|alpha`. This admits only the
exercised request/response and header-bag path; files, cookies, sessions,
trusted proxies, streamed responses and a real HTTP SAPI remain separate
gates.

The pinned Symfony Routing S1 fixture builds real `Route` objects, dumps their
compiled matcher tables and executes the unmodified `CompiledUrlMatcher`. It
compares a static GET, a constrained dynamic route with extracted defaults, a
405 including its allowed methods and a 404 against reference PHP. Its exact
output is `health|article_show:rphp-8:html|405:GET,HEAD|404`. This admits the
exercised compiled matcher path, including Symfony's branch-reset/MARK regex;
URL generation, localized/host routes, condition expressions and broader route
loader formats remain separate gates.

The pinned Symfony DependencyInjection S1 fixture asks the unmodified
`ContainerBuilder` and `PhpDumper` 7.4.16 to compile a small graph under
reference PHP, then executes the generated PHP unchanged under RPHP. It checks
constructor injection, an inlined private dependency, a public alias, shared
service identity, a compiled parameter lookup and a missing-service probe. Its exact
output is `hello RPHP|same|hello|missing`. The generated class deliberately
uses a minimal fixture base so this gate does not claim the full Symfony
`Container`, lazy services, service locators, environment processors,
Reflection-driven compilation or a cold RPHP container build; those remain
S2/S3 gates.

The pinned Symfony warmed-kernel S2 fixture installs FrameworkBundle 7.4.16
and its exact locked closure with checksum-pinned Composer 2.8.12. Reference
PHP boots a `prod`, `debug=false` kernel and generates the container and
compiled route cache. RPHP loads those generated files unchanged, handles an
in-memory GET `/health`, runs kernel termination and shutdown, and must match
reference PHP exactly at `200|warmed|OK`; the gate also verifies that RPHP did
not mutate the warmed cache. This admits only the exercised short-lived CLI
lifecycle. RPHP does not yet cold-build the cache, provide an HTTP SAPI, prove
repeated-worker isolation, or claim broad Symfony application compatibility;
those remain the separate S3 and S4 gates.

`use function` imports have their own case-insensitive alias table, separate
from class imports. Direct calls support default, explicit and comma-separated
aliases, retain imports inside methods and closures, and suppress the ordinary
namespaced-to-global fallback for an explicitly imported target. Imports remain
lexical, so string names passed to `function_exists()` are unchanged.

Includes inside functions and methods inherit caller locals, `$this`, and
lexical private-access scope without leaking local bridge values into the real
global table. Explicit `global` declarations still bind the real global.
Included throws, missing required files, and parse failures propagate through
the caller's catch table; `ParseError` is registered under `CompileError`, which
extends `Error`.

Relative to the retained `102800d` baseline, the current run adds 40 passing
cases without losing a previous pass. The retained `0fafdd4` checkpoint isolates
four of them: object-property chains became legal `isset` targets, intermediate
null/scalar/property reads remain silent, inaccessible and uninitialized
properties do not leak, multiple operands short-circuit, and
`__isset`/`__get` run in PHP order with catchable exceptions. The same exception
propagation repair also closes an older ordinary `__get` regression.

Relative to the retained `9c8812d` baseline, this run adds 98 passing cases
without losing a previous pass. A single postfix loop now covers offsets,
dynamic calls, object access and class constants for every primary atom instead
of selected parser entry points. Source-aware, case-insensitive magic constants
cover file, directory, line, namespace, class, trait, function and method scope;
fully-qualified built-in constants also discard their global namespace marker
before lookup. Includes receive their own canonical source context. These
shared changes reduce runtime failures by 169 and parser failures by 42; some
tests now reach later output or compile-time checks, so those classifications
increase even though the exact pass set only grows.

Relative to the retained `1a5a270` baseline, this run adds 277 passing cases
without losing a previous pass, reduces parser failures by 786 and reduces
signal-terminated cases from 14 to 4. The measured change covers standard
comma-separated `echo`, standalone `print` statements and generator-safe call
argument suspension, empty/no-op and general expression statements, heredoc and
nowdoc strings, body-less abstract class and trait method contracts, and
class-like constants across classes, interfaces, traits and enums. Constant
support includes visibility, `final` and typed declarations, inheritance and
composition checks, late-static reads, enum aliases and common constant
expressions; repeated runtime reads use an ID-and-index inline cache.
Dynamic class-constant fetch now accepts runtime string or object owners,
braced names, `self`/`parent`/late-static scope, enum cases and constant
expressions while preserving PHP's `::class`, visibility, type-error and
left-to-right evaluation rules. Owner/name cache entries are revalidated
independently. Function-call results also continue through ordinary postfix
method/property chains, which accounts for several generator-suite passes.
Interface and abstract declarations now share compile-time LSP validation for
arity, variadics, reference mode, visibility, staticness and declared types. It
does not infer support for the remaining downstream behavior of every case that
now parses. The retained `f6a20c1`, `1bc6650`, `18e4dde`, `81de421`, `7ab1941`,
`21f2d98`, `67a924d`, `e107bf2`, `42ea718`, `9c8812d`, `102800d`, `0fafdd4` and
`c470183` results isolate the earlier syntax, abstract-method, shared-contract,
string-literal, class-constant, postfix, magic-constant, `isset` and autoload
uplifts.

An audit found that the earlier runner did not preserve php-src's generated
`.php` basename and section-ending newline, omitted the `%0` `EXPECTF`
placeholder, and did not reproduce the reference CLI's INI defaults. Schema 2
fixes those issues and reports upstream `XFAIL` separately. A full oracle run
through the corrected runner on the exact official PHP 8.4.21 CLI produced
5,132 passes, zero ordinary failures, 121 skips, five unsupported SAPI sections
and the one upstream `XFAIL`. The set of 522 RPHP passes is byte-for-byte
unchanged from `e107bf2`; the correction therefore validates the low strict
rate instead of inflating it.

The largest first-error parser clusters in the latest audit are property hook
or braced-member shapes (232), reference assignment expressions (155),
anonymous classes (80), unpacking expressions (74), identifier grammar (66),
variable-variable names (59), and returned-by-reference declarations (57).
PHPT is an exact-output conformance suite: a correct rejection with different
diagnostic text still fails, so this strict percentage is deliberately lower
than feature reach.

A fresh all-features rerun of retained commit `102800d` over all 5,259 pinned
cases reproduced every published status and aggregate exactly. Together with
the 5,132-pass, zero-failure reference-PHP oracle, this rules out sharding,
discovery, and expectation matching as the cause of the low strict rate. The
remaining gap is in RPHP behavior and PHP-compatible diagnostics, not a hidden
runner divisor.

The current schema-4 audit also found a measurement bug that affected using
PHP 8.5 as a local oracle for the pinned PHP 8.4 suite: PHP 8.5 enables
compile-time fatal backtraces by default. The runner now restores the PHP 8.4
diagnostic profile for reference runs and covers it with a regression fixture.
It also records the runner commit independently and separates failed
pre-execution setup and exact negative-test passes in the execution profile.
Rerunning RPHP changed none of the 5,259 path statuses or categories, so this
fix corrects calibration and descriptive reach without inflating the 627-pass
compatibility result.

The dependency-free project runner supports `FILE`, `FILEEOF`,
`FILE_EXTERNAL`, `EXPECT`, `EXPECTF`, `EXPECTREGEX`, `SKIPIF`, `INI`, `ENV`,
`ARGS`, `STDIN`, `CLEAN` and extension declarations, with explicit capability
classification where the runtime cannot execute a section. Its expectation and
section handling are continuously covered by local fixtures and the complete
oracle result above.

The complete machine-readable result is committed as
[`80137b6-arm64-manifest.jsonl`](../tests/php-src/results/php-8.4.21/80137b6-arm64-manifest.jsonl),
with aggregate metadata in
[`80137b6-arm64-summary.json`](../tests/php-src/results/php-8.4.21/80137b6-arm64-summary.json).
Every upstream path remains visible with its pass/fail/skip/XFAIL/unsupported/
timeout/crash status and classification.

## Default build

End-to-end tests cover representative behavior in these areas:

- scalar values, arithmetic, comparisons, strings, arrays, references, and
  copy-on-write paths;
- conditionals, loops, `foreach`, `switch`, `match`, null coalescing, and
  nullsafe access;
- functions, closures, arrow functions, variadics, named arguments,
  generators, selected callable forms, and request-local SPL autoload stacks;
- classes, constructors, inheritance, interfaces, traits, visibility, clone,
  magic methods, constants, namespaces, and `instanceof`;
- scalar/object type declarations, strict types, exceptions, `try`/`catch`/
  `finally`, and selected reflection behavior;
- selected standard-library functions, JSON, regular expressions, and core
  stream behavior.

This list describes tested areas, not complete coverage of each PHP feature.
Exact supported edge cases are defined by the source and tests on the commit
being run.

## Opt-in surfaces

| Cargo feature | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `jit-prototype` | Native execution for selected guarded regions on macOS/AArch64 and Linux/x86-64 |
| `coroutines` | Experimental structured cooperative tasks, channels, timers, and readiness APIs |
| `php-generics-erased` | Experimental generic syntax with bound-erased runtime behavior |
| `php-generics-reified` | Experimental generic syntax with reified runtime sidecars and checks |
| `file-contents`, `file-write`, `file-lines`, `include-path` | Incremental file/include functionality |
| `stream-*`, `csv-*`, `resource-lifetime`, `value-errors` | Incremental stream, resource, and error behavior |
| `vm-stats` | Internal execution and JIT diagnostics |

The generic syntax is an RPHP experiment, not part of the default PHP
compatibility claim. Feature names and APIs can change without deprecation
during pre-alpha development.

## Known major gaps

- complete PHP syntax, edge-case semantics, standard library, and extension
  coverage;
- Composer packages and framework applications, including Symfony;
- HTTP/FPM or another production web SAPI, WebSockets, and server lifecycle;
- databases, Redis, cURL, and most external integrations;
- production cycle collection, resource limits, sandboxing, and security
  hardening;
- BigInt/BigDecimal and broad specialist extension compatibility;
- complete JIT coverage and supported native backends beyond the two primary
  CI targets;
- stable embedding, extension, bytecode, CLI, or Rust APIs.

Missing behavior may fail at lexing, parsing, compilation, or execution. Error
messages and exit codes are not yet fully PHP-compatible.
